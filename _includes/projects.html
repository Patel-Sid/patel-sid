      <h5> UTSearCh (Search Engine) </h5>
      <ul>
        <h13> Made using Java/Vue/HTML/CSS/Javascript</h13>
      </ul>
      <p>Designed and developed a search engine in a team of five for instructors and students at the University of Toronto Scarborough. Anyone can use the search engine but users also has the option to sign up and create an account which will give them access to more features. We leveraged Google's Identity Platform API instead of reinventing the wheel and creating a seperate authetication. After creating an account users have the option of uploading .txt, .html and .pdf files which can be related to a specific course or may contain research papers. The search engine then indexes these data files and creates/updates the global index.</p>

      <ul>
        <h13> Made using HTML/CSS/Javascript</h13>
      </ul>
      <p>I and my team members created a chrome extension called NumLock during a hackathon at Univeristy of Toronto Scarborough called Hack the Valley 2. We know nowadays more and more young kids are spending their time on the internet. For this reason parents often worry whether their child is learning enough or not. Well no need to worry anymore! Our app let's parents block a particular website and will only unblock it if your child can correctly answer all questions on the screen within the given time!</p>

      <h5> Basic Image Processing </h5>
      <ul>
        <h13> Made using C</h13>
      </ul>
      <p>Implementing some functions for manipulating images. Here I use the PPM (portable pix map) format, as it is one of the easiest to understand and process. PPM is often used as an intermediary format, i.e. the lowest common denominator color image format, that nearly all other formats (e.g. jpg, gif, png) can be translated to and from.</p>

      <h5> Image Database </h5>
      <ul>
        <h13> Made using C</h13>
      </ul>
      <p>The database will allow users to query its contents to find all images that have particular attributes. More precisely, the database will keep track of three different attributes for each image: its predominant colour, shape and texture. The database will support three different functions: The user can add new images to the database by specifying the file name and the values for the three attributes. The user can query the database by specifying the values for the three attributes and the database will return the names of all image files that match these attributes. The user can ask to have the database contents printed to the screen (i.e. the names of all files stored in the database together with their attributes).</p>

      <h5> The Encryption Algorithm </h5>
      <ul>
        <h13> Made using Python</h13>
      </ul>
      <p>A program to encrypt and decrypt text using an encryption algorithm. Such an algorithm describes a process that turns plaintext into what looks like gibberish (we'll call this ciphertext), and decrypts the ciphertext back into plaintext. For example, the program will be able to take a secret message written in ciphertext, and figure out what it says....Like: XHXZCHRYTMWEHOPPB.</p>

      <h5> Regular Expressions Program </h5>
      <ul>
        <h13> Made using Python</h13>
      </ul>
      <p>Regular expressions (abbreviated to regex, the pronunciation of which gives rise to endless A.M.E wars. . . ) are used in various programming languages and utilities to match entire classes of strings. This program will model a regular expression as a tree, and detect which strings match a given regular expression.</p>
