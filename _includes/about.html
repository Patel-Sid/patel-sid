      <p>Python is one of my favourite languages to work with given it's simplicity. 
        My last big project involved creating an XML converter which was coded entirely using Python. 
        On the other hand, I have created several projects with Java including Vacuum Game and the Flight Booking application. 
        Last but not the least, I have been using C to work on my latest projects shown below. 
        My upcoming goal is to build upon my knowledge in C and transition into learning C++.</p>

      <p>Proeficient in using ditributed version control systems such as Git and SVN. 
        My first team-based app Flight Booking Application was an Andriod app. The back end was written in Java while the UI was designed using Andriod Studio. 
        This project gave me a good understanding on how both the front and back end interact to create a seamless user experience for the final product.</p>
